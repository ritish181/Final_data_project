 1. Raw (Fact) Tables
These tables will store transactional or event-based data, capturing specific actions such as enrollments, feedback, and engagement tracking. The goal is to collect raw, granular data that can be analyzed and aggregated.

- Enrollment:
  - Represents transactions where employees enroll in courses.
  - Columns: EnrollDate, QuizScore, EmployeeID, CourseID.

- Engagement:
  - Represents activities where employees engage with a specific course or module.
  - Columns: TimeStart, TimeEnd, TimeSpent, IsCompleted, EmployeeID, ModuleID, CourseID.

- Feedback:
  - Stores feedback data for each course, capturing user ratings and comments.
  - Columns: Rating, Comment, SubmittedAt, EmployeeID, CourseID.

- Discussion:
  - Captures employee discussions related to courses, serving as event-based records.
  - Columns: Text, PostDate, EmployeeID, CourseID.

 2. Dimension Tables
Dimension tables contain descriptive or reference data, which provide context to the raw data. These are typically smaller and more stable than fact tables.

- Employee:
  - Represents employees with details like their name, email, department, and role. This table can serve as a reference to analyze engagement and feedback by employee attributes.
  - Columns: EmployeeID, Name, Email, Department, Team, Role.

- Course:
  - Stores details about courses, which will serve as a reference for enrollments, feedback, and engagement.
  - Columns: CourseID, CourseName, CourseDescription, CreationDate, Author, Image.

- Module:
  - Represents the course modules that employees interact with.
  - Columns: ModuleID, ModuleName, ModuleDescription, CourseID.



# Example for creating a fact table from filtered DataFrames

# Engagement Fact Table
fact_engagement = filtered_engagements.groupby(['EmployeeID', 'ModuleID', 'CourseID']).agg({
    'TimeSpent': 'sum',
    'IsCompleted': 'max'  # Assuming you want the max value of IsCompleted for the fact
}).reset_index()

which department has count enrolled course engage more time
